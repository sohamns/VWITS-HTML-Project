        <p>The Class 11 Maths Syllabus 2022-23 consists of 5 units which accounts for 80 marks for theory exam. The CBSE Class
            11 Maths Syllabus is a crucial resource for students that help them in exam preparation. It provides the details on
            the course structure, exam pattern and marks weightage of Maths exam. Before preparing for the Class 11 Maths exam,
            students should go through the syllabus to know what they will study for the 2022-2023 academic year. Referring to
            the Maths Syllabus will work as a checklist for students of CBSE Class 11. They can quickly analyse the topics that
            they have covered and the topics they need to complete.</p>
